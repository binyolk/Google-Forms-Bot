# Google Forms Bot
 Upcoming bot that automatically fills out x responses to a designated Google Form.

 Note 1: Only applicable for short forms with mainly multiple choice and at most one short response question.
 Note 2: If not directly specified, the program will input nothing into typed answer questions, which causes it to fail if those questions are required.

# TODO
- ~~Random choice from scraped values~~
- ~~Actually check the radio value for randomly selected choice~~
- ~~Do the same for all~~
- ~~Put " " for short answer/long response unless otherwise specified~~
- ~~Submit form~~
- ~~Repeat x times~~

- ~~Make form url and responses sys available~~

- Follow Google Sheet results, identify human trends and weight options accordingly instead of being purely random
